# FAKE-NEWS-DECTION


my web application seeks to predict erroneous information, based on
classification model. The latter is a primary interface,
this is what the user sees once he opens the application. The logo and two others
links, one of which will lead us to another interface with details about the creators
application, are located at the top of the page. The other link will take us back to the page
home. By entering the news in the input field in the middle of this page
and by clicking on "Submit", the user of our web application can use this
interface to verify the veracity of the information. Our application then performs the
detection and presentation of results.

# NLP template creation process
One of the most popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks is the
classification of the text (or categorization). This involves assigning a tag to a
unstructured text that corresponds to a specified class. In simple terms, the clas-
sification is the process of assigning a label to a text, indicating
that it belongs to a specific class. To do this, we have taken various measures,
which are presented in the following diagrams.

# Example of use cases

Our web application was able to identify the class of each new and af-
file the result accordingly which shows and confirms the correct operation of
our program. To test the functionality of our application, we have attri-
two new, one is false and the other is true, the result is represented in the
next screenshot.
