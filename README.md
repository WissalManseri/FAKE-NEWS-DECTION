# FAKE-NEWS-DECTION


my web application seeks to predict erroneous information, based on
classification model. The latter is a primary interface,
this is what the user sees once he opens the application. The logo and two others
links, one of which will lead us to another interface with details about the creators
application, are located at the top of the page. The other link will take us back to the page
home. By entering the news in the input field in the middle of this page
and by clicking on "Submit", the user of our web application can use this
interface to verify the veracity of the information. Our application then performs the
detection and presentation of results.
